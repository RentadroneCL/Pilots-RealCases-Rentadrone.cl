  For the construction of the multispectral orthomaps (For each spectral band and for each Vegetation index) the Open Source  application    has been used is OpenDroneMap: Drone Mapping Software (https://www.opendronemap.org/)

  To review the orthomaps, enter each folder corresponding to each "Barrack" of the vineyard download each one. To view the files you can use the Open Source QGIS application (https://www.qgis.org/es/site/)
